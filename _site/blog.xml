<section id="from-not-being-able-to-program-to-deep-learning-expert" class="level1">
<h1>From not being able to program to deep learning expert</h1>
<ul>
<li>Understand the value of Stack Overflow, documentation and how to reach both.</li>
<li>Learn to use a code editor really well.</li>
<li>Learn to use git for version control.</li>
<li>Learn how to use local or cloud VM.</li>
<li>How to complete a lecture:-
<ul>
<li>Watch the lecture</li>
<li>Open the notebook and try to find out how all the pieces fit together.</li>
<li>If you encounter some new functions then it will be good to know about them.</li>
<li>Tweak the hyperparameters and see how it performs.</li>
<li>Once you understand, try to create a new notebook recreating the training pipeline that is demonstrated in lecture.</li>
<li>Now if everything is working well, then you might want to test the same technique on another dataset of similar type.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="theory-vs-practice-" class="level1">
<h1>Theory vs practice:-</h1>
<ul>
<li>If you aim to reach the highest echelons of deep learning research, you first and foremost need to be a great practitioner!</li>
<li>For best effects, use one cup of theory, one cup of practice. Rinse and repeat</li>
<li>We are reading papers, but without training actual models, without the experience of applying what we are learning to real-life problem, we are missing a very important feedback loop.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="programming-is-about-what-you-have-to-say-" class="level1">
<h1>Programming is about what you have to say:-</h1>
<ul>
<li>Your ability as a developer is measured by the utility of the things you can express in a language.</li>
<li>Reading and writing a lot of code is the best way to learn a programming language.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="the-secret-of-good-developers-" class="level1">

<section id="the-best-way-to-improve-as-a-developer-" class="level1">
<h1>The best way to improve as a developer:-</h1>
<ul>
<li>You don’t sharpen your skills with resources, books, or articles. You sharpen your skills with practice. If you want to get better, go do the thing.</li>
<li>Read and write a lot of code.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="how-to-use-your-tools-to-achieve-a-state-of-flow" class="level1">
<h1>How to use your tools to achieve a state of flow</h1>
<ul>
<li>You are in a state of flow when nothing separates you and your work</li>
<li>That’s why many programmers spend a lot of time studying their editors</li>
<li>We are always somewhere between two extremes (state of flow)</li>
<li>All we can do is take small steps and see if it is taking us towards the ideal.</li>
<li>This can take our productivity to a whole new level.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="use-reality-as-your-mirror-" class="level1">
<h1>Use reality as your mirror:-</h1>
<ul>
<li>If you want to live a different life tomorrow than you are living today, you have to put your beliefs to the test.</li>
<li>The stronger the emotions involved in a situation, the higher the chance you are not seeing things clearly.</li>
<li>Suppose you want to post something and you are afraid that people whom I respect will unfollow me or they will say I am stupid, but that doesn’t matter in the long run.</li>
<li>Post it and you will learn on the way.</li>
<li>Thinking about writing something isn’t doing the thing.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="do-genuine-work-it-compounds-" class="level1">
<h1>Do genuine work (it compounds):-</h1>

<li>Genuine work moves the atoms in the universe.</li>
<li>Always make notes.</li>
<li>Share whatever you have made.</li>
<li>The more atoms you move the better the feedback you receive and the greater the extent to which you can reflect on what you are learning.</li>
</ul>

<section id="how-to-structure-a-machine-learning-project-" class="level1">
<h1>How to structure a machine learning project:-</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>The main condition for a healthy machine learning project is a good train-val-test split.</p></li>
<li><p>Always have a baseline to get to know whether i am going in right direction or not or what can be done next.</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t run experiments just for the sake of tweaking hyperparameters, instead invest time in exploring other architectures, developing diagnostic code.</p></li>
<li><p>The idea is to always move in small increments, using simpler models as a stepping stone to more complex ones.</p></li>
<li><p>Define loss and implement it on simple model consisting of few layers and then check by passing a batch if output is not all zeros and the output shape is required shape.</p></li>
<li><p>Create a subset of train data(1%) to check whether the modified code is working and the we are going in the right direction.</p></li>
<li><p>Read as much as possible related to the domain you are working on so that our mind can work on the solution and analyze what to do next.</p></li>
<li><p>Go slowly and give attention to each component of the pipeline and grow them systematically.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="how-to-win-at-kaggle-" class="level1">
<h1>How to win at Kaggle:-</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>Join the competition early.</p></li>
<li><p>Learn about the problem domain and data</p></li>
<li><p>Write diagnostic code and identify where model is struggling.</p></li>
<li><p>Follow Kaggle forums and read daily.</p></li>
<li><p>Try to find out the relevant research papers and see if it is useful in solving the problem.</p></li>
<li><p>You can read blogs related to the problem you are solving.</p></li>
<li><p>While early in the competition, try on different architectures instead of tweaking the hyperparameters.</p></li>
<li><p>How do we know that we are moving in the right direction? So first of all create a baseline and make a submission. The submission can consist of all zeros.</p></li>
<li><p>Try to find out a validation split that will track the public leaderboard.</p></li>
<li><p>A proper validation split lies at the heart of any good Kaggle submission.</p></li>
<li><p>To know that if we are going in the right direction, see if the local results matches with the leaderboard. If so then you are going in the right direction and if not then try to find out other ways of splitting the data or something else.</p></li>
<li><p>You can do ensembling also. the idea is to cancel out the errors from individual model in a hope that their errors are not correlated.</p></li>
<li><p>A related technique is training with cross-validation, where you train multiple models withholding different parts of the data for validation and then combine the results from them.</p></li>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<ul>
<li><p>In this blog, we will try to understand how different attention mechanisms work alongside vanilla attention from 2017 paper</p></li>
<li><p>For the code part, you can checkout this <a href="https://github.com/riteshrm/Quantization-in-Depth-deeplearning.ai-">link</a></p></li>

<section id="issue-with-rnns" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="issue-with-rnns">Issue with RNNs</h3>
<ul>
<li>Informaton Bottleneck:- If sentence is too much long, they needed to compress all the previous token information in just a single vector h</li>
<li>Sequential Nature:- All the tokens being processed one by one</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="quotient-rule" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="quotient-rule">Quotient rule</h3>
<ul>
<li>Will be used while finding out the derivative of softmax</li>
<li><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cleft(%5Cfrac%7Bu%7D%7Bv%7D%5Cright)'%20=%20%5Cfrac%7Bu'v%20-%20uv'%7D%7Bv%5E2%7D">.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="transformers" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="transformers">Transformers</h3>
<ul>
<li>Given a sequence of length N, where each token is represented by Dmodel numbers, we compute three matrices
<ul>
<li>Query = XWq (what I’m looking for)</li>
<li>Key = XWk (what I have)</li>
<li>Value = XWv (the information I’ll give if I’m relevant)</li>
<li>Wq and Wk are of same shape and to maintain the symmetry Wv is also kept to be of same shape, Wq,Wk [Dmodel, Dk] and Wv [Dmodel, Dv]</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Now to find out which key is more relevant to given queries we do matrix multiplication and the finally apply softmax to get probability
<ul>
<li>score = QueryKey^T</li>
<li>attn = softmax(score/sqrt(Dk))</li>
<li>Why scaling factor
<ul>
<li>this score dot product has variance of Dk, which causes instability in backpropagation
<ul>
<li>lets say we have two vectors q and k of dimension dk</li>
<li>E[qi]=E[ki] = 0</li>
<li>var[qi]=var[ki] = 1</li>
<li>then E[q.k] = 0 but var[q.k] = dk <a href="https://funnywii.com/upload/proof.pdf">link</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li>the derivative of softmax contains some terms which if not normalizaied lead to gradient nearly 0 becuase of this larger variance</li>
<li><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctext%7BSoftmax%7D(z_i)%20=%20%5Cfrac%7Be%5E%7Bz_i%7D%7D%7B%5Csum_j%20e%5E%7Bz_j%7D%7D"></li>
<li><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial%20%5Ctext%7BSoftmax%7D(z)_i%7D%7B%5Cpartial%20z_j%7D%20=%20%5Ctext%7BSoftmax%7D(z)_i%20(%5Cdelta_%7Bij%7D%20-%20%5Ctext%7BSoftmax%7D(z)_j)"></li>
<li>If <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?z_i"> is much larger than other elements, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctext%7BSoftmax%7D(z)_i%20%5Capprox%201">.</li>
<li>If <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?z_i"> is much smaller, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctext%7BSoftmax%7D(z)_i%20%5Capprox%200">.</li>
<li>So incase of jacobian matrix, considering a simple case where query 0 attends all the keys
<ul>
<li>Diagonal: <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?s_1(1-s_1)%20%5Capprox%201(0)%20=%200">.</li>
<li>Off-Diagonal: <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?-s_1%20s_2%20%5Capprox%20-1(0)%20=%200">.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>to enforce unit variance, we apply normalization by dividng the score by standard deviation i.e.&nbsp;sqrt(Dk)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="linear-attention">Linear Attention</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Instead of using softmax, it tries to make it more general where this softmax function can be replaced by any other function</p></li>
<li><p>Kernel is some function which takes in two input vectors (query and key) and gives a single scalar output i.e.&nbsp;similarity score.</p></li>
<li><p>This softmax can also be replaced by some kernel which is some kind of similarity function (i.e.&nbsp;to have property of a similarity function).</p></li>
<li><p>Kernel can be decomposed into linear functions (feature functions)</p>
<ul>
<li>K(a, b) = phi(a)Tphi(b)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Feature function takes a vector as input and projects it into new feature space</p></li>
<li><p>The basic idea is instead of doing complicated non-linear function like softmax, cant we just project a and b into highr dimensional space and just do the linear inner product</p></li>
<li><p>The attention mechanism is defined as <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A_l(x)%20=%20V'%20=%20%5Ctext%7Bsoftmax%7D%20%5Cleft(%20%5Cfrac%7BQK%5ET%7D%7B%5Csqrt%7BD%7D%7D%20%5Cright)%20V">.</p></li>
<li><p>We can make the above equation more generalised by using a simlarity function</p></li>
<li><p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?V'_i%20=%20%5Cfrac%7B%5Csum_%7Bj=1%7D%5EN%20%5Ctext%7Bsim%7D(Q_i,%20K_j)%20V_j%7D%7B%5Csum_%7Bj=1%7D%5EN%20%5Ctext%7Bsim%7D(Q_i,%20K_j)%7D"></p></li>
<li><p>where we can think of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctext%7Bsim%7D(q,%20k)%20=%20%5Cexp%20%5Cleft(%20%5Cfrac%7Bq%5ET%20k%7D%7B%5Csqrt%7BD%7D%7D%20%5Cright)"></p></li>
<li><p>only constraint on sim is to give non-negative outputs</p></li>
<li><p>given a kernel with feature representation <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cvarphi(x)">, we can rewrite the above equation</p></li>
<li><p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?V'_i%20=%20%5Cfrac%7B%5Csum_%7Bj=1%7D%5EN%20%5Cphi(Q_i)%5ET%20%5Cphi(K_j)%20V_j%7D%7B%5Csum_%7Bj=1%7D%5EN%20%5Cphi(Q_i)%5ET%20%5Cphi(K_j)%7D"></p></li>
<li><p>By making the use of associative property of matrix multiplication, we can take out Q from summation, because it is independet of j</p></li>
<li><p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?V'_i%20=%20%5Cfrac%7B%5Cphi(Q_i)%5ET%20%5Csum_%7Bj=1%7D%5EN%20%5Cphi(K_j)%20V_j%5ET%7D%7B%5Cphi(Q_i)%5ET%20%5Csum_%7Bj=1%7D%5EN%20%5Cphi(K_j)%7D"> (4)</p></li>
<li><p>And finally we can convert it into vectorized format</p></li>
<li><p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cleft(%20%5Cphi(Q)%20%5Cphi(K)%5ET%20%5Cright)%20V%20=%20%5Cphi(Q)%20%5Cleft(%20%5Cphi(K)%5ET%20V%20%5Cright)"></p></li>
<li><p>It is linear because we can compute numerator and denominator and use it for all the queries [The eqn before vectorized one]</p></li>
<li><p>For softmax attention, complexity is O(N^2 * max(D, M)), where D is dimensionality for query and key, M is for value</p></li>
<li><p>For linear attention, complexity is O(NCM), where C is feature map projection dim and M is for value</p></li>
<li><p>Linearization of exact spftmax attention is not feasible because of the exponential kernel, which is of infinte dimension and cant be stored on a computer (expansion of e^x is infinitely many terms)</p></li>
<li><p>Thats why it is better to use some kind of polynomial feature representation</p></li>
<li><p>The author chose elu instead of relu to avoid setting gradients to 0 when input was negative</p></li>

<li>Assymetric Mode:-
<ul>
<li>map [r_max, r_min] to [q_max, q_min]</li>
<li>This is what we have implemnted above</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Symmetric Mode:-

<ul>
<li>where r_max = max(|tensor|)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
We don’t need to use zero point(z=0). this happens because the floating point range and the quantized range are symmetric with respect to zero

<p><strong>Trade-off</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Utilization of quantized range:</p>
<ul>
<li>when using asymmetric quantization, the quantized range is fully utilized</li>
<li>When symmetric mode, if the float range is biased towards one side, this will result in a quantized range where a part of the range is dedicated to values that we’ll never see.(e.g ReLU where the output is positive)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Simplicity:</p>
<ul>
<li>Symmetric mode is much simpler compared to asymmetric mode.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Memory: We don’t have to store zero-point for symmetric quantization</p></li>
<li><p><strong>We use symmetric quantization for 8-bit, but as we go for lower bits such as 2 or 4 bits, we use asyyemtric quantization</strong></p></li>

<ul>
<li><p>When we create nn.Parameters, pytorch expects that parameter where it’s able to compute gradients on it.</p></li>
<li><p>The issue is that with PyTorch, you can’t explicitly compute gradients on INT8 tensors.</p></li>
<li><p>So above code snippet will give an error saying that only tensors of floating point and complex dtype can require gradients.</p></li>
<li><p>So the right approach to save INT8 weights is instead of saving attributes as being an endless parameter, is to call the method called register buffer.</p></li>
<li><p>This way instead of storing a parameter, we just store a buffer, meaning we don’t need to compute gradients on the tensor.</p></li>
<li><p>You can initialize it with whatever dtype you want.</p></li>

It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file. Please open an issue on GitHub for any issues related to this experimental feature.

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="weights-packing">Weights Packing</h3>
<ul>
<li>Weights packing is important for storing quantized weights, because torch.int4 is not available as of today, so we need to store and load the weights in int8</li>
<li>This is not ideal because:
<ul>
<li>tensor will occupy 8-bit per datapoint and might add a considerable overhead for large models</li>
<li>There would be no point of quantizing to 2/4 bits becuase we are still using 8-bit</li>
</ul></li>
<li>So, we need to pack values</li>
<li>Consider a tensor with 4 values each with 2-bit(0,1,2,3) precision but stored in 8-bit
<ul>
<li>tensor = torch.tensor([1,0,3,2], dtype=torch.uint8)</li>
<li>1:- 00000001</li>
<li>0:- 00000000</li>
<li>3:- 00000011</li>
<li>2:- 00000010</li>
</ul></li>
<li>We can pack all these values into a single 8-bit value as 177
<ul>
<li>177:- 10110001</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Adavantages:-
<ul>
<li>It reflects the true memory footprint of the quantized weights Disadvantages:-</li>
<li>The unpacked tensors need to be a shape with a multiple of 8//nbits</li>
<li>It needs to unpack before performing an operation</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><p>Emergent features at scale:- Simply some characteristics or features which appear at scale, when model is large.</p></li>
<li><p>Features predicted by the model meaning the magnitude of the hidden states started to get large thus making the classic quantization schemes quite obsolete, which led to classic linear quantization algorithms just failing on these models.</p></li>
<li><p>Now how to deal with outlier features for LLMs</p></li>
<li><p>Outlier features simply means hidden states with large magnitude.</p></li>
<li><p>So there are some interesting papers such as LLM.int8, SmoothQuant, AWQ.</p>
<ul>
<li>LLM.int8 separates the matmul in two steps:-
<ul>
<li>For non-outliers (smaller values)
<ul>
<li>Perform matmul in int8, then dequantize it.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>For outliers (larger values)
<ul>
<li>Perform matmul in classical way(basically in the dtype of hidden states usually half precision and then you combine these results)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>SmoothQuant
<ul>
<li>Applies A8W8 scheme(quantize weights and activations)</li>
<li>Given an input it determines some factor and use it to quantize.</li>
<li>migrates the scale variance from activations to weights to reduce the quantization difficulty of activations.</li>
<li>the smoothed activation and the adjusted weight are both easy to quantize.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>AWQ
<ul>
<li>Used a calibration dataset to find out which weights could be responsible of generating outlier features called salient weights.</li>
<li>and then use that information to scale the weights before quantization and also use that scale during inference to rescale the input as well.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Recent SOTA quantization methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>LL.INT8</li>
<li>GPTQ</li>
<li>SmoothQuant</li>
<li>QLoRA</li>
<li>AWQ</li>
<li>QuIP#</li>
<li>HQQ</li>
<li>AQLM</li>
<li>………..</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Challenges of Quantization</p>
<ul>
<li>Retraining (Quantization Aware Training) [less explored]</li>
<li>Limited Hardware support</li>
<li>Calibration dataset needed</li>

<ul>
<li><p>Quantization refers to the process of mapping a large set to a smaller set of values.</p></li>
<li><p>How do we convert the FP32 weights to INT8 without losing too much information??</p>
<ul>
<li>It is done using a linear mapping using linear mapping parameters.</li>
<li>s = scale</li>
<li>z = zero point</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>How do we get back our original tensor from the quantized tensor?</p>
<ul>
<li>We can’t get exactly the original tensor but using dequantization following linear relationship that used to quantize the original tensor.</li>
</ul></li>

<p><strong>Quantize Using Quanto Library</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>from quanto import quantize, freeze</li>
<li>quantize(model, weights = desired_dtype, activations = desired_dtype)</li>
<li>freeze(model)</li>
<li>quantize create an intermediate state of the model</li>
<li>after calling freeze, we get the quantized weights</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Uses of the Intermediate State</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Calibration
<ul>
<li>Calibrate model when quantizing the activations of the model.
<ul>
<li>Range of activation values depends on what input was given. (e.g.&nbsp;different input text will generate different activations)</li>
<li>Min/Max of activation ranges are used to perform linear quantization.</li>
<li>How to get min and max range of activations?
<ul>
<li>Gather sample input data.</li>
<li>Run inference.</li>
<li>Calculate min/mac of activations</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Result: better quantized activations</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Quantization Aware Training
<ul>
<li>Training in a way that controls how the model performs once it is quantized.</li>
<li>Intermediate state holds both(quantized as well as unquantized weights).</li>
<li>Use quantized version of model in forward pass (e.g.&nbsp;BF16)</li>
<li>Update original, unquantized version of model weights during back propogation (e.g.&nbsp;FP32)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In L4 there is a function in helper.py to calculate the model size</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Linear Quantization</strong></p>
<p>Even if it looks very simple, it is used in many SOTA quantization methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>AWQ: Activation-aware Weight Quantization</li>
<li>GPTQ: GPT Quantized</li>
<li>BNB: BitsandBytes Quantization</li>
</ul>

<li>Simple idea: linear mapping</li>
<li>r = s(q-z)
<ul>
<li>where</li>
<li>r:- original value(e.g.&nbsp;in FP32)</li>
<li>s:- scale(e.g.&nbsp;in FP32)</li>
<li>q:- quantized value(e.g.&nbsp;in INT8)</li>
<li>z:- zero point(e.g.&nbsp;INT8)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>How do we get scale and zero pint??
<ul>
<li>s = (r_max-r_min)/(q_max-q_min)</li>

<p>Recent SOTA quantization methods:-</p>
<ul>
<li>LLM.INT8 (only 8-bit)
<ul>
<li>Decomposes the mat-mul in two stages (outlier part in float16 and non-outlier part in int8).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>QLoRA (only 4-bit)
<ul>
<li>Quantize as well as fine-tune the adapters</li>
</ul></li>
<li>AWQ</li>
<li>GPTQ</li>
<li>SmoothQuant</li>
</ul>
<p>More recent SOTA quantization methods for 2-bit quantization</p>
<ul>
<li>QuIP#</li>
<li>HQQ</li>
<li>AQLM</li>
</ul>
<p>All are <strong>open-source</strong></p>
<p>Some Quantization Methods require calibration (from above)</p>
<p>Some Quantization Methods require Adjustments</p>
<p>Many of these methods were applied to LLMs, but if we want then we can apply to other type of models by making few adjustments to the quantization methods</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Some methods can be applied without making adjustments</p>
<ul>
<li>Linear quantization</li>
<li>LL.INT8</li>
<li>QLoRA</li>
<li>HQQ</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Other approaches are data-dependent</p></li>
<li><p>There are distributors on HuggingFacewhich gives a quantized version of popular models (TheBloke)</p></li>
<li><p>Checkout HuggingFace Open <strong>LLM leaderboard</strong> to see how these quantized models are performing</p></li>
<li><p>Benefits of fine-tuning a quantized model:</p>
<ul>
<li>Recover the accuracy from quantization</li>
<li>Tailor your model for specific use-cases and applications</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Fine tune with Quantization Aware Training (QAT)</p>
<ul>
<li>Not compatible with Post Training Quantization (PTQ) techniques.</li>
<li>The linear quantization method is an example of PTQ.</li>
<li><a href="https://pytorch.org/blog/finetune-llms/">PEFT + QLoRA</a>
<ul>
<li>QLoRa quantizes the pre-trained base weights in 4-bit precision.</li>
<li>This matches the precision of the LoRA weights.</li>
<li>This allows the model to add the activations of the pre-trained and adapter weights.</li>
<li>This sum of the two activations can be fed as the input to the next layer of the network.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
